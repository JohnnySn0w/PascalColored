I thought pascal's triangle was p cool so I decided to color code it a little to see what would happen. Not dissapointed. Will likely add further functionality, like changing the colors or the coloring rules. 

Feel absolutely free to play with this and add functionality, I think it has a lot of potential as a teaching and research tool.



Currently:

-the color is determined by whether or not the coefficient can be divided evenly into a number. The highest number is 7, and anything that's prime higher than 7 is caught and colored for that. The rest of the coefficients that fall under being divisible by 6/5/4/3/2, are colored based on whichever number that they can evenly divide into is highest. so 12 is colored based on 6. 

-font size is hard coded currently, because I didn't want to deal with the headache of making it percentage based atm. 24+ characters gets 8px font, 35+ characters gets 4px, 49+ 2px, and 99+ gets 1px.
